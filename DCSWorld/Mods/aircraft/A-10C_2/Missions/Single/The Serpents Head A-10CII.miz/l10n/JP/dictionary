\
Given the current escalation of political tensions, along with increasingly bold skirmishes initiated by South Ossetian Separatists, it has become obvious the current US training forces in Georgia will become embroiled in the regions ethno-political conflict soon. \
\
Recent Intelligence has made it increasingly clear that South Ossetian forces are being bolstered by \"Volunteers\" and heavy equipment. \
\
These are thought to be arriving in the region by the Trans-Caucasus Highway and the strategic Roki Tunnel. \
\
It is understood that Russia has, at best, been turning a blind eye to the activities of training camps, operating within Russian Territory, assisting these \"Volunteers\".\
\
The influx of Military equipment is also a worrying development as it suggests active Russian involvement in destabilising the region.\
\
The current assessment of the situation is that Russia wants to keep Georgia on the back foot, rather that engaging in another full scale mobilisation, for now.\
\
However it is felt that the current influx of Hardware and Personnel to South Ossetia must be stemmed. \
\
To this end it has been decided to try to eliminate the Commander of the South Ossetia Forces, codenamed \"Cobra\", who is believed to be in Russia at one of these training camps.\
\
 The camp is to the South West of Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia\
