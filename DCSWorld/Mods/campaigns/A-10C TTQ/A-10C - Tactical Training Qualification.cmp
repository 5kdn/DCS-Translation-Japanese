\
Phase 1: Academic Classes and Pre-Flight Training\
Phase 2: Basic Flight Training Qualification\
Phase 3: Advanced Aircraft Training Qualification\
Phase 4: Tactical Training Qualification\
\
Phase 1 Academic Classes and Pre-Flight Training: Initial Qualification Training (IQT)\
Is a pre-requisite for Phase 2. To complete Phase 1 execute the in game training missions and fly some test missions. Read the A-10C Flight Manual to become familiar with the A-10C aircraft systems and instruments.\
\
Phase 2 Basic Flight Training Qualification: Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ).\
This qualification phase measures your ability to fly the aircraft and work the navigation systems. It is a pre-requisite for Phase 3.\
\
Phase 3 Advanced Aircraft Training Qualification: Basic Mission Capable (BMC).\
This qualification phase measures your ability to execute basic mission capabilities including air to air refueling and evading threats as well as working all weapons systems. It is a pre-requisite for Phase 4.\
\
Phase 4 Tactical Training Qualification: Combat Mission Ready (CMR).\
This qualification phase measures your ability to execute more advanced mission capabilities including working with JTACS and Airborne FACs, using Wingmen, performing CAS, CSAR and Deep Interdiction mission types.\
\
Each Phase of training will contain individual Performance Objectives (POs) that must be met to pass the course. Performance Checks (PCs) will be used to determine if you have met the requirements of the PO.\
\
Following each Check Ride flight your Flight Examiner (FE) will rate you using one of the following proficiency levels as directed in A/OA-10 – Aircrew Evaluation Criteria: AFI11-2A-OA-10V2:\
\
Qualified (Q): Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.\
\
Qualified Minus (Q-): Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of omission or commission.\
\
Unqualified (U): Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.\
\
In addition for any flight missions:\
\
Qualified (Q): Altitude +/- 200 feet, Airspeed +/- 5%, Course +/- 5 degrees / 3 NM (whichever is greater)\
\
Qualified Minus (Q-): Altitude +/- 300 feet, Airspeed +/- 10%, Course +/- 10 degrees / 5 NM (whichever is greater)\
\
Unqualified (U): Exceeded Q- limits\
\
Phase 4: Tactical Training Qualification contains:\
\
Close Air Support Tactical Stage:\
\
TAC11 - FAC & JTAC Coordination\
TAC12 - Stationary and Moving Target Tasking\
TAC13 - Danger Close Tasking\
TAC14 - SEAD Tasking\
\
Battlefield Air Interdiction Tactical Stage:\
\
TAC15 - Deep Interdiction Tasking Day\
TAC16 - Deep Interdiction Tasking Night\
TAC17 - Deep Interdiction Tasking Special Forces Coordination\
\
Airborne Forward Air Controller (AFAC) Tactical Stage:\
\
TAC18 - SADL Datalink Engagement\
TAC19 - CAS Mission Management Day\
TAC20 - CAS Mission Management Night\
TAC21 - BAI Mission Management Day\

\
Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Tactical Stage:\
\
TAC23 - CSAR Management Day\
TAC24 - CSAR Management Night\
\
Tactical Summary Stage:\

\
フェーズ１：アカデミッククラスとプレフライトトレーニング\
フェーズ２：基本飛行訓練検定\
フェーズ３：上級航空機訓練検定\
フェーズ４：戦術訓練検定（Tactical Training Qualification）\
\
フェーズ１は初期認定訓練（IQT: Initial Qualification Training）を行います。また フェーズ２への前提条件となります。A-10Cフライトマニュアルを読んで、A-10Cの航空機システムと計器類に精通してください。 \
\
フェーズ２は基本航空機検定（BAQ： Basic Aircraft Qualification）です。\
この検定フェーズは航空機の操縦とナビゲーションシステムの操作について認定します。これはフェーズ３への前提条件となります\
\
Phase 3 は上級航空機訓練検定で基本ミッション能力（BMC）を認定します。\
この検定フェーズは、基本ミッション能力（空中給油、驚異の回避、全ての兵器システム）があるかどうかを審査します。これはフェーズ４の前提条件となります。\
\
Phase 4 戦術訓練検定：戦闘任務準備（CMR: Combat Mission Ready）\
この検定フェーズは、より高度なミッション能力（JTACや空中FACとの作業、ウイングマンの使用、CASの実行、CSARやDeep Interdiction mission types）があるかどうかを審査します。\
