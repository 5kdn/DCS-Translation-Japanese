\
This story-driven campaign puts you in cockpit of the Warthog as part of a small, 6-ship US detachment sent to Georgia. Your mission isto help contain a growing threat from a terrorist organization calling itself the \"Caucasus Liberation Army\" (CLA). As the story unfolds, you will be  faced with a variety of challenges, including close air support, precision strikes, combat search and rescue, anti-ship strikes, and even air to air combat.\
\
Striving to be as realistic as possible, the units featured in the  campaign are based on their real-life counterparts. It also uses a sophisticated radio control system, meaning that you must tune your on-board radios to the correct frequency to hear the more than 2000 custom voiceovers available throughout 21 missions.\
\
Compared to the original campaign, version 3.0 offers following great additions and changes:\
\
- 20 out of 21 missions have been rewritten from scratch. This includes the course of action, dialogues, briefings and background information.\
- More than 2/3 of the missions take place in different locations than the original ones, and most feature different challenges and enemies to provide a completely new experience,\
- 3 entirely new missions that are designed to complement and extend the storyline.\
- The 8 pilot and 3 commander characters featured throughout the campaign have almost 4x more custom voiceovers (over 2100).\
- Additional documents and custom kneeboard pages are available for each sortie.",

\
このストーリー進行形キャンペーンでは、あなたはジョージアに派遣された６機のアメリカ派遣部隊の一員としてWarthogのコクピットに座ります。あなたの任務は、増大する「コーカサス解放軍（Caucasus Liberation Army：CLA）」と呼ばれるテロ組織の驚異を封じ込めることとです。ストーリーが進につれて、近接航空支援、精密攻撃、戦闘捜索救助、対艦攻撃、空対空戦闘など様々な課題を与えられrます。\
\
可能な限りリアルになるように、キャンペーンに登場する部隊は、実際のものに基づいています。正確な無線通信システムを使用していますので、21個のミッションで聞ける2000以上のカスタムボイスオーバーを適切に聞くには、搭載無線機を正しい周波数に合わせる必要があります。\
\
元のキャンペーンと比較して、バージョン3.0では次の大きな追加変更が加えられています。：\
\
- 21のうち20のミッションをゼロから書き直ししました。これには、一連のアクション、ダイアローグ、ブリーフィング、背景情報が含まれます。\
- ３分の２のミッションで、元のミッションとは異なる場所になっています。殆どの場合で全く新しい体験を提供できるよう、様々な課題と敵が登場します。\
- ３つのミッションは、ストーリーラインを補完および拡張するために全く新しく設計しました。\
- 8人のパイロットと３人の指揮官には、ほぼ4倍のカスタムボイスオーバー（2100以上）を用意しています。\
- 追加のドキュメントやカスタムニーボードページは各出撃ごとに用意しています。",
