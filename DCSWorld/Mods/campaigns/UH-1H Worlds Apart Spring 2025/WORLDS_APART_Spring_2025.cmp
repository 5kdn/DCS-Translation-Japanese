\
状況\
2025年初頭、世界の治安状況は更に悪化しました。３つの超大国はお互い他国と交渉はしていますが、対決姿勢でいます。多くの国で分離主義（separation efforts）が進む中、いくつかの代理戦争と内乱が起こります。\
\
また、経済的利益と自然資源の保護は地域間の摩擦を激化させました。\
特に黒海地域はEMEA （Europe, the Middle East and Africa：ヨーロッパ、中東、アフリカ）地域の中で、注目をあつめ、常に緊迫した地域でした。\
\
\
全体的な状況は非常に複雑でわかりにくい状況でした。\
穏健な中央政府と戦う、ジョージア軍内の反乱軍の横で、トルコの反乱軍が日常的に国境を超えてきていました。\
ジョージアの反乱軍は、昔のジョージア領であるアブハジアと南オセチアを再統合させるために戦っていました。\
地域内では、隣接地域から来たアブハジアと南オセチアの武装勢力は連合ジョージア（ジョージア、アブハジア、南オセチアの連合）のために活動している地元ジョージア住民を援助しています。特に、ウクライナ極右ファシストグループはアブハジア内でロシア軍と戦っています。\
国連主導の下で多くの国が軍隊を派遣し、争い合う武装グループを分離しています。\
 \
 \
ドイツ軍の一部は、ジョージア南部地域の確保と、トルコとの国境地域の平和と安全のために戦っている政府軍への支援活動を担当しています。\
私達は、まだ建設中のドイツ司令本部があるバトゥミにやってきた最初の部隊の一員です。\
 \
あなたの役割 \
あなたとあなたの部隊は、最近バトゥミに到着しました。\
実際の状況はおおむね穏やかですが、トルコとの国境地域ではまだ戦闘があります。情報局がほんの数日前に警告を発しました。彼らの情報によると、バトゥミエリア内で、ジョージア反乱軍（ジョージアの元陸軍兵と空軍兵で充実した装備を所有）とウクライナファシストグループとが連携作戦を計画しています。\
あなたの実際に仕事：北のクタイシに再配属される前に、バトゥミ地域確保に向けて活動するジョージア軍とドイツ陸軍を支援してください。\
部隊でのコールサインは「ウルフパック」で、支援を担当します。軽武装のパトロール、兵士や資材の輸送を行います。さらなる指示があるまでは、あなたの部隊はバトゥミ空港にいます。ほとんどのフライトはバトゥミから離発着します。",
